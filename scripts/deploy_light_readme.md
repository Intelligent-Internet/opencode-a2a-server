# Lightweight Local Launcher (`deploy_light.sh`)

This document describes `scripts/deploy_light.sh`, a lightweight entry point for
starting one local OpenCode + A2A instance in the foreground.

## Convergence Notice (#181)

`deploy_light.sh` has converged into a foreground-only launcher. It no longer
manages background process lifecycles (nohup/stop/restart) or per-instance log/PID files.
It is designed to be consumed by external process managers like `pm2`, `systemd`,
or higher-level orchestrators for **parameterized self-deployment** (#145).

Scope:

- stays in foreground (stdout/stderr direct output)
- supports the same **Autonomous Deployment Contract** as `deploy.sh`
- does **not** create system users or isolated data roots
- best suited for local development or ephemeral agent-managed instances

## Usage

Required environment:

```bash
export A2A_BEARER_TOKEN='<a2a-token>'
```

Start one instance (foreground):

```bash
./scripts/deploy_light.sh workdir=/abs/path/to/workspace
```

The script accepts an optional `start` command for backward compatibility:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_light.sh start workdir=/abs/path/to/workspace
```

Recommended consumption with `pm2`:

```bash
pm2 start ./scripts/deploy_light.sh --name "a2a-alpha" -- workdir=/data/alpha a2a_port=8010
```

## Key Inputs

- `workdir`:
  required; becomes the default `OPENCODE_DIRECTORY` exposed to the A2A layer
- `a2a_host` / `a2a_port` / `a2a_public_url`:
  A2A listen address and published URL
- `opencode_bind_host` / `opencode_bind_port`:
  local OpenCode bind address for the supervised `opencode serve`
- `opencode_provider_id` / `opencode_model_id`:
  default upstream provider/model selection
- `opencode_lsp`:
  whether to enable LSP in generated OpenCode config content
- `start_timeout_seconds`:
  readiness wait budget for both OpenCode and A2A startup

## Readiness Behavior

On start, the script:

1. validates required inputs and local commands
2. starts `opencode serve`
3. waits until `GET /session` succeeds on the configured OpenCode bind address
4. starts `opencode-a2a-server`
5. waits until the local Agent Card endpoint responds successfully

If either process fails readiness or exits, the script stops the other child process and exits.

## Security / Scope Notes

- `A2A_BEARER_TOKEN` is still required.
- Provider secrets are inherited from the current shell environment.
- The current Linux user remains the trust boundary.
- All consumers of one lightweight instance still share the same underlying workspace/environment.
- This flow is not tenant-isolated and is not a replacement for stronger deployment isolation.
