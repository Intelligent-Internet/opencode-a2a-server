# opencode-a2a-server

> Turn OpenCode into a stateful A2A service with a clear runtime boundary and production-friendly deployment workflow.

`opencode-a2a-server` exposes OpenCode through standard A2A interfaces and adds
the operational pieces that raw agent runtimes usually do not provide by
default: authentication, session continuity, streaming contracts, interrupt
handling, deployment tooling, and explicit security guidance.

## Why This Project Exists

OpenCode is useful as an interactive runtime, but applications and gateways
need a stable service layer around it. This repository provides that layer by:

- bridging A2A transport contracts to OpenCode session/message/event APIs
- making session and interrupt behavior explicit and auditable
- packaging deployment scripts and operational guidance for long-running use

## What It Already Provides

- A2A HTTP+JSON endpoints (`/v1/message:send`, `/v1/message:stream`,
  `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}:subscribe`)
- A2A JSON-RPC endpoint (`POST /`) for standard methods and OpenCode-oriented
  extensions
- SSE streaming with normalized `text`, `reasoning`, and `tool_call` blocks
- session continuation via `metadata.shared.session.id`
- request-scoped model selection via `metadata.shared.model`
- OpenCode session query/control extensions and provider/model discovery
- systemd multi-instance deployment and lightweight current-user deployment

## Extension Capability Overview

The Agent Card declares six extension URIs. Shared contracts are intended for
any compatible consumer; OpenCode-specific contracts stay provider-scoped even
though they are exposed through A2A JSON-RPC.

| Extension URI | Scope | Primary use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `urn:a2a:session-binding/v1` | Shared | Bind a main chat request to an existing upstream session via `metadata.shared.session.id` |
| `urn:a2a:model-selection/v1` | Shared | Override the default upstream model for one main chat request |
| `urn:a2a:stream-hints/v1` | Shared | Advertise canonical stream metadata for blocks, usage, interrupts, and session hints |
| `urn:opencode-a2a:session-query/v1` | OpenCode-specific | Query external sessions and invoke OpenCode session control methods |
| `urn:opencode-a2a:provider-discovery/v1` | OpenCode-specific | Discover normalized OpenCode provider/model summaries |
| `urn:a2a:interactive-interrupt/v1` | Shared | Reply to interrupt callbacks observed from stream metadata |

## Design Principle: Single-Tenant Self-Deployment

One `OpenCode + opencode-a2a-server` instance pair is treated as a
single-tenant trust boundary. This project supports **parameterized
self-deployment**, allowing consumers to spin up their own isolated instance
pairs programmatically.

- **Autonomous Deployment Contract:** Both `deploy.sh` and `deploy_light.sh`
  follow a machine-readable contract for input validation, readiness checking,
  and status reporting.
- **Isolation by Instance:** OpenCode may manage multiple projects, but one
  deployed instance is not a secure multi-tenant runtime.
- **Consumption Strategy:** For mutually untrusted tenants, consumers should
  trigger separate deployment cycles with unique ports, isolated Linux users (via
  `deploy.sh`), or isolated workspace roots.

    Runtime --> Workspace["Shared workspace / environment boundary"]
```

This repository wraps OpenCode in a service layer. It does not change OpenCode
into a hard multi-tenant isolation platform.

## Recommended Client Side

If you need a client-side integration layer to consume this service, prefer
[a2a-client-hub](https://github.com/liujuanjuan1984/a2a-client-hub).

It is a better place for client concerns such as A2A consumption, upstream
adapter normalization, and application-facing integration, while
`opencode-a2a-server` stays focused on the server/runtime boundary around
OpenCode.

## Security Model

This project improves the service boundary around OpenCode, but it is not a
hard multi-tenant isolation layer.

- `A2A_BEARER_TOKEN` protects the A2A surface, but it is not a tenant
  isolation boundary inside one deployed instance.
- LLM provider keys are consumed by the OpenCode process. Prompt injection or
  indirect exfiltration attempts may still expose sensitive values.
- systemd deploy defaults use operator-provisioned root-only secret files
  unless `ENABLE_SECRET_PERSISTENCE=true` is explicitly enabled.
